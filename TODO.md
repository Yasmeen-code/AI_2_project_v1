# TODO: Enhance Plant Form Design

- [x] Update laravel_app/plant-care/resources/views/plant_form.blade.php with modern CSS styling, including gradients, better typography, icons, animations, and responsiveness.
- [x] Further improve the design based on user feedback: adjust colors, add more subtle animations, enhance mobile responsiveness, and add a loading state for better UX.
- [x] Change the form layout from vertical stacked to a horizontal or grid layout to make it less tall and more compact.
- [ ] Test the updated page by running the Laravel application and verifying the visual improvements.
